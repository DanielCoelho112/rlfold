## Setup
- Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:DanielCoelho112/rlfold.git`
- Download [CARLA 0.9.10.1](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.10.1).
- Run the docker container with `docker run -it --gpus all --network=host -v results_path:/root/results/rlfold -v rlfold_path:/root/rlfold danielc11/rlfold:0.0 bash`
where `results_path` is the path where the results will be written, and `rlfold_path` is the path of the rlfold repository.


## Training
- Start the CARLA server
- Run: `python3 rlfold/run/python3 main.py -en rlfold_original`


## Credits
Thanks to the authors of [End-to-End Urban Driving by Imitating a Reinforcement Learning Coach](https://github.com/zhejz/carla-roach)
for providing a framework to train RL agent in CARLA.
